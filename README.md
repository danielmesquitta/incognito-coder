# Incognito Coder

## Features

Incognito Coder offers a range of features designed to assist users during coding interviews. A key characteristic of the tool is its stealth; it remains undetectable during screen sharing sessions on platforms like Zoom and is reportedly not flagged by browser-based coding assessment tools such as HackerRank and CodeSignal.

## Core Functionality and Usage:

While Go is the default language, users can switch to JavaScript, Java, Python or other supported languages.

Problem statements are captured via screenshots; users can take up to five screenshots of a webpage using the 'Super + print screen' command. After capturing the problem, pressing 'super + enter' initiates the extraction and automatic generation of a solution code.

## Solution Presentation and Interaction:

The generated solution appears in a translucent, movable overlay that can be positioned over the user's primary coding environment. This overlay's visibility can be toggled without interrupting the user's coding workflow, meaning the active coding tab remains in focus and the cursor position is unchanged.

To further aid users, the solution includes concise "thoughts" that can be verbalized to an interviewer, along with detailed line-by-line comments for a deeper understanding of the code. An analysis of time and space complexity is also provided with the solution. Should a user wish to restart, a reset function is available via the 'Super + R' shortcut.
